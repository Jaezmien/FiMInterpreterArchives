# NetFiM
A FiM++ interpreter made in C#
(send help)




lol this project is dead, might pick up on it when i take a hiatus from NotITG stuffs














Note: This Github repo is not always being updated, so all of the progress that I might post might use updated code.

**Why?**

(When I started this "project",) I was currently 13 years old and I wanted to do something "cool", MLP-related, and not game-related. Looking up some eso-langauge, I found out FiM++, which is I think a dead project (though if it's still being worked on, please let me know!). As I wanted to brush up on my C# skills, I just said "eh, why not" and made an interpreter in C#.

------------------------------

COMPILING:

uH

i use sharpdevelop to do this monstrosity so idk what vs community version will work

<b>WHAT'S CURRENTLY WORKING:</b>

Everything here is not completely done :[

Calling other methods/paragraphs

Write/Output/Print

Variable Creation [both global and local]

While/If Else Conditionals

Incrementing/Decrementing with custom amount

------------------------------

<b>HOW TO USE IT</b>

First, create a folder where the ``NetFiM.exe`` is.

Then, just add a ``main.fpp`` file inside it and code away!

To run the file, just open the program and type the name of the folder.

You can also move the folders on the ``Example`` folder to the program's folder and run them!
